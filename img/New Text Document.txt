hi this me trying to do some changes here to see if can make commits on GitHub
the second change to this file is to test git fetch origin/master
git fitch will update local repo but does not merge new to changes to the master branch
git pull will automatically merge master branch with origin/master
you can think of fetch as half of git pull
it is very helpfull when you make a commit in local repo and its not in remot repo
